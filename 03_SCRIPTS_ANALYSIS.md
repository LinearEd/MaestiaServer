# Lua Scripts Analysis

## Overview
- **Location**: `Unpacked_data\script\`
- **File Count**: 6,070 Lua scripts
- **Purpose**: Game logic, quests, NPC behaviors, events

## Script Categories (Estimated)

### Quest Scripts

## Integration
Scripts work with:
- CBD database (data definitions)
- NPC_data files (NPC instances)
- Zone files (placement and triggers)
- Emulator engine (execution environment)

## Analysis Tasks
1. Categorize scripts by type/purpose
2. Identify commonly used functions/APIs
3. Extract quest data structure
4. Document scripting API
5. Find dependencies between scripts

## Value
These scripts contain the actual game logic - critical for:
- Understanding game mechanics
- Server emulation accuracy
- Content recreation
- Custom content development

## Status
⚠️ Requires detailed examination - sample script analysis needed
